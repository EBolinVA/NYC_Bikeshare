# Bikesharing

This project involved analyzing a bikeshare business in New York City with one month of data from a .csv file download. To clean the data, I first used jupyter notebook and python to convert the 'tripduration' column to datetime. Tableau was then used to visualize the data and see trends. (See additional images to view python code)

## Business Questions
The company was seeking insight into the following questions:

How many customers do we have in August 2019? Are there any peak hours?
How many rides are typically taken per weekday? Are the rides distributed evenly by gender?
How are rides distributed between customers and subscribers to the bikeshare app?

## Using Tableau for Visualization
My goal with the storyboard was to make it accessible and easy to read for the stakeholder. I wanted the answers to their questions to be easily identified in the static image of the dashboards. The stakeholder can also use the filters on each page of the story to further visualize the data.

## Next Steps
Further visualization which would be helpful for stakeholders would be utilization by 'bikeid'. There are a handful of overutilized bikes and there may be trends to show for maintenance and repair or replacement. Finally, average tripduration by gender per hour on the busiest bike stations would be helpful to stakeholders, so that they may understand the need to ferry bicycles from overcrowded stations during peak ride times.
